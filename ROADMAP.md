## 🎯 v4.0: Intelligence + Performance (10 Weeks)

### Theme: "The Most Intelligent MCP Gateway"

**Ship Date**: Week 10  
**Deliverable**: Working cache, self-correcting tools, reasoning engine, production safety

### Phase 1: Alpha (Weeks 1-5) - Foundation

#### 🚀 Flagship Feature: Intelligent Caching System
**Task**: [MCPROXY-adt](https://github.com/your-repo/mcproxy/issues/MCPROXY-adt)

Multi-tier cache that dramatically accelerates agent workflows by avoiding redundant tool calls.

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-tier architecture**: Global cache (shared) + Session cache (isolated) + Namespace isolation
- **Smart TTL**: Per-namespace limits (trading: 60s, docs: 3600s) with agent override capability
- **Cache API**: `cache.clear()`, `cache.invalidate()`, `cache.stats()`
- **LRU eviction**: Automatic cleanup of least-recently-used entries
- **Memory backend**: Fast in-memory cache (Redis support in v4.1)

**Subtasks**:
- [MCPROXY-adt.1](https://github.com/your-repo/mcproxy/issues/MCPROXY-adt.1) - Cache Core (interface + basic operations)
- [MCPROXY-adt.2](https://github.com/your-repo/mcproxy/issues/MCPROXY-adt.2) - Multi-Tier Architecture
- [MCPROXY-adt.3](https://github.com/your-repo/mcproxy/issues/MCPROXY-adt.3) - TTL Management
- [MCPROXY-adt.4](https://github.com/your-repo/mcproxy/issues/MCPROXY-adt.4) - Cache Management API + LRU

**Impact**: 50% reduction in tool calls, 3x faster workflows

#### 🔍 Simplified Search
**Task**: [MCPROXY-auk](https://github.com/your-repo/mcproxy/issues/MCPROXY-auk)

Remove depth levels, make search behavior automatic based on query.

**Changes**:
- Empty query → Server list with tool counts
- Query provided → Matching tools with descriptions
- Fewer parameters = less confusion

**Impact**: Simpler API, better discoverability

#### 🧠 Self-Correcting Tool Usage

**Enhanced Search with Schemas** - [MCPROXY-7v0](https://github.com/your-repo/mcproxy/issues/MCPROXY-7v0)
- Include `inputSchema` and auto-generated usage examples in search results
- Agents see exactly how to call tools without trial-and-error

**Fuzzy Tool Name Matching** - [MCPROXY-29c](https://github.com/your-repo/mcproxy/issues/MCPROXY-29c)
- Suggest correct tool names on errors using Levenshtein distance
- "Tool 'serch' not found. Did you mean 'search'?"

**Fuzzy Search + Auto-Inspect** - [MCPROXY-ibi](https://github.com/your-repo/mcproxy/issues/MCPROXY-ibi)
- Auto-inspect tool schema when calls fail
- Self-correcting behavior without agent intervention

**Impact**: 60% reduction in tool call errors

#### 💭 Built-in Reasoning Engine
**Task**: [MCPROXY-5vi](https://github.com/your-repo/mcproxy/issues/MCPROXY-5vi)

Agents think before acting on dangerous operations.

**Features**:
- `think=True` parameter triggers reasoning before execution
- Configurable engine: `sequential_thinking`, `think_tool`, `atom_of_thoughts`
- Auto-trigger on dangerous operations (delete, drop, production)
- Override with `think=False` for trusted operations

**Impact**: 80% reduction in dangerous operation errors

---
